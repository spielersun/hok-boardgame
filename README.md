# HOUSE OF KLEMSEN

Klemsen R. Johns was born on May 25, 1864 in Basel, Switzerland. His parents were literate-politicians who tried to help the world leaders to establish a more civilised and free world. Their mission is unfinished because they were killed when he was a little boy. But he followed their footsteps and become a world-known scientist. Also he continued their work all by himself and build a house that is independent from space and time to defeat his powerful enemies. He is gathering most talented people from around the world. You are his new recruits from the 21st century, he placed various enemies which he brings from all over the space/time to his house. You should defeat them and reach to the roof to meet him and join him. Only one of you will succeed, other will perish in this house. You two are not the only ones who move in this house, there is also a giant blind biobot who is coming down from the roof towards entrance.
